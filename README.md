# Flickr React Gallery App

For this project, I'll use the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of the powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app will be built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

A great project to learn about some of the best practices of working with React, like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in my JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.

With the powerful Create React App tool - I used:

    JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
    React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
    Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and to display images in my app.
    Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
